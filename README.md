## 📖 About Commit-AI

**Commit-AI** transforms raw, technical code changes into **human-readable, professional documentation**. By leveraging Groq's inference engine (Llama 3.1 8B), it acts as a bridge between your terminal and your project's history.

### 🧠 The Logic

The tool reads your **Git Diff** to understand:

- **Intent:** Adding a feature or fixing a regression?
- **Impact:** What specific logic changed within the functions?
- **Context:** Automatically filters out noise like `package-lock.json` or `node_modules`.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Installation

**For Go Users:**

```bash
go install github.com/NeelFrostrain/Commit-Ai-Go@latest

```

**For Windows (Non-Go Users):**

1. Download the latest `commit-ai-installer.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/NeelFrostrain/Commit-Ai-Go/releases/latest/).
2. Run the installer. It will automatically move the binary to your `AppData` and update your `PATH`.

### 2️⃣ Configuration (One-Time Setup)

You don't need to manually create `.env` files.

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys) to get your key.
2. Run `commit-ai` in any terminal.
3. Paste your key when prompted. **Commit-AI** will save it to `~/.commit-ai-key` and your System Registry for global access.
